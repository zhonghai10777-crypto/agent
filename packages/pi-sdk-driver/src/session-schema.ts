/**
 * Session-file schema-version skew detection.
 *
 * pi session files carry a header version. The bundled runtime migrates older
 * files up, but a file written by a NEWER pi (a user's global CLI ahead of the
 * app's bundled runtime) is consumed as-is: unknown entry types/roles are
 * silently dropped by transcriptFromMessages / buildSessionContext, so content
 * disappears with no signal. We cannot render what the bundled runtime cannot
 * parse, so instead we detect the skew and surface it, letting the app warn the
 * user that some content may not display.
 *
 * Detection is conservative: only a header version strictly greater than the
 * bundled runtime's is flagged (no false positives relative to the runtime
 * version). Missing/unknown/older versions are never flagged, so current and
 * older sessions see zero behavior change. Note this keys off the version
 * number, not the actual entries — a newer pi that bumps the version without
 * introducing unparseable entries would flag with nothing actually lost.
